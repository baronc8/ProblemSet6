# PS6


  This app is about helping prospective students find out the average cost of different types of colleges in different states. Users are able to use different tabs such as the table tab. On that tab users are able to filter out the costs between different school types. For example if users want to look at a table form of data on average private school costs for the state of Washington, they are able to search and filter those options out. Users are also able to look at visually the trend between different states and their average tuition rates. There are also different colors to differenciate between the states on the plot.
